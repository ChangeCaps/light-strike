Light Strike
============

Light strike is a game written in rust with a custom game-engine, 
using the [glium](https://docs.rs/glium/0.26.0-alpha3/glium/) crate
for Open-GL bindings.

The engine is based on a Data Oriented Design with an Entity Component System
for optimal CPU utilization.

It is currently very early in devlopment. Any contributions are greatly appreciated!
